This demo uses BART with Matlab to perform a Wave-CAIPI reconstruction followed by a retrospective Wave-CS
reconstruction. The Wave-CS recon uses the BART C API to extend the forward model in a parallel imaging and
compressed sensing reconstruction.

See example output in the [`html`](html)
directory, and run the Matlab demo [`demo_wave_cs.m`](demo_wave_cs.m).

# Data download
The Wave-Caipi datasets were kindly provided by Dr. Berkin Bilgic at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging.

Please download the Wave-Caipi datasets from the following link to the directory demos/wave-cs/data:
